# **Windows Wallpaper-Based Cuckoo Evasion**  
An unconventional take on sandbox evasion—more of a proof of concept.  

### **Disclaimer**  
This project is intended solely for **educational and research purposes**. It explores an unconventional approach to sandbox detection and is **not designed, endorsed, or intended for malicious activities**. The methods described here should be used **responsibly and ethically**, in accordance with cybersecurity best practices and legal guidelines.  

Any misuse of this information for unauthorized or harmful purposes is **strictly discouraged**. The author assumes **no responsibility** for actions taken based on this content. If you are conducting security research, always follow **ethical hacking principles** and obtain proper authorization when testing in real-world environments.

### **Concept Overview**  
Every file has a hash, right? So, what are the **default hashes** for Windows 11 or Windows 10 wallpapers? If we check for those hashes, we can make an educated guess that the system is an **unmodified version of Windows**, where the user has not altered personalization settings.  

However, **Cuckoo Sandbox** uses a custom **meme wallpaper**, so if we **do not** detect a default Windows wallpaper, we can **immediately** terminate the program and run cleanup and self-deletion. This method **would not be used in isolation**, but rather as a supplemental check—perhaps when a potential threat actor's script fails to locate a **Cuckoo-associated DLL**.  

This is a **rough and unconventional OS fingerprinting technique** designed to attempt **Cuckoo evasion**, in short.

### **Limitations**  
- **User customization**: If a user has changed their wallpaper, the check will Fail, causing the script to **continue execution/Deletion hypothetically** as if it were a sandboxed system.  
- **Sandbox variability**: Other sandbox environments, such as **Any.Run**, tend to use **default Windows wallpapers**, meaning the script would run normally within those environments.  
- **Volatility**: Because this method relies entirely on a **single environmental factor (wallpaper hash)**, it is **highly volatile** and dependent on system personalization.  
- **Not standalone**: Due to these limitations, this evasion method **should not be used in isolation**. It may work best when combined with additional environmental checks, such as **DLL fingerprinting, registry queries, or process behavior analysis**.
