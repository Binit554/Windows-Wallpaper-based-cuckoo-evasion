## Introduction

Sandbox environments are essential tools for analyzing malware behavior. However, many malware developers create strategies to evade detection in these environments. This project demonstrates one such method using Windows wallpapers. By manipulating how a system interacts with its visual environment, we can create scenarios that challenge traditional sandbox detection methods.

## Topics Covered

This repository touches on various important topics in cybersecurity, including:

- **Cuckoo Sandbox**: A popular open-source automated malware analysis system.
- **Cyber Security**: The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Strategies used by malware to avoid detection and analysis.
- **Malware Analysis**: The process of understanding malware behavior and impact.
- **PowerShell**: A task automation framework that is often used in malware development.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Binit554/Windows-Wallpaper-based-cuckoo-evasion.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Windows-Wallpaper-based-cuckoo-evasion
   ```

3. Ensure you have PowerShell installed on your system, as the scripts are designed to run in this environment.

## Usage

To use the wallpaper-based evasion technique, you will need to download and execute the necessary files. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Binit554/Windows-Wallpaper-based-cuckoo-evasion/releases) to find the latest version.

### Running the Script

1. Download the latest release.
2. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Execute the script:

   ```powershell
   .\your_script_name.ps1
   ```

This will initiate the wallpaper manipulation process.

## How It Works

The core idea behind this project is to use the Windows wallpaper as a means to evade sandbox detection. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Wallpaper Manipulation**: The script changes the desktop wallpaper to create a deceptive environment. This can confuse the analysis tools that rely on specific visual cues.

2. **Behavioral Analysis**: By observing how the malware interacts with the altered environment, researchers can gather insights into its behavior without triggering typical detection mechanisms.

3. **Feedback Loop**: The project incorporates a feedback mechanism that allows researchers to adjust parameters based on initial findings. This iterative process enhances the effectiveness of the evasion technique.

### Example Scenarios

- **Dynamic Wallpaper Changes**: The script can change wallpapers at intervals, creating a constantly shifting environment that complicates analysis.
- **Contextual Manipulation**: By using wallpapers that mimic system alerts or notifications, the malware can blend in more seamlessly with normal user activity.
