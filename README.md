# **Windows Wallpaper-Based Cuckoo Evasion**  
An unconventional take on sandbox evasion—more of a proof of concept.

### **Concept Overview**  
Every file has a hash, right? So, what are the **default hashes** for Windows 11 or Windows 10 wallpapers? If we check for those hashes, we can make an educated guess that the system is an **unmodified version of Windows**, where the user has not altered personalization settings.  

However, **Cuckoo Sandbox** uses a custom **meme wallpaper**, so if we **do not** detect a default Windows wallpaper, we can **immediately** terminate the program and run cleanup and self-deletion. This method **would not be used in isolation**, but rather as a supplemental check—perhaps when a potential threat actor's script fails to locate a **Cuckoo-associated DLL**.  

This is a **rough and unconventional OS fingerprinting technique** designed to attempt **Cuckoo evasion**, in short.
